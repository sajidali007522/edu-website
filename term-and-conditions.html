            <h2>General Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <h3>General Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) of SOFY GmbH (Product edupression.com®)</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>


<section class="inner-info-wrap">
    <div class="container">
        <h3>1. General</h3>
        <p>
            1.1 SOFY GmbH (hereafter "SOFY") is a registered company in the Austrian Commercial Register under the number FN 488003 b, which provides a (fee-based) platform with Products in the field of depression treatment (hereafter „Products“) under the trademark edupression.com® , under the web address  <a href="#">https://edustatic.wpdeveloper.at</a> (hereafter "Website") and via mobile applications. The platform principally provides psychoeducational content in the form of courses with learning units and videos (hereafter „psychoeducation“) as well as a mood chart. In addition, SOFY also provides certain free information and Products (hereafter „Free Products“). The Products are presented in more detail in the service description under Clause 3. of these terms and conditions and on the Website, in particular. <br>

            1.2 The Products and Free Products provided by SOFY are not a substitute for medicinal or psychotherapeutic treatments. 1.3 Should you currently be experiencing suicidal thoughts, have plans to commit suicide, or if these occur while using our Products or Free Products, you must immediately contact a psychiatric outpatients department, a known emergency number (especially an ambulance service) or a psychiatrist. Our Products and Free Products are not appropriate for these situations. 1.4 SOFY provides Products exclusively for adult individuals. The use of Products by underage individuals requires the prior agreement of the parent or guardian of the underage individual.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Scope</h3>
        <p>
            These General Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) apply to all Products and Free Products provided by SOFY in the domain edupression.com®. SOFY only makes contracts with customers and provides Products and Free Products to Users if these T&Cs, in their respective version are applied. These T&Cs apply, as amended, at the time the contract is made. It is requested that the User reads through these T&Cs carefully before using Products and Free Products.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Service description</h3>
        <p>
            Products currently include, among others, a learning platform (Learning Management System) with around 20 course modules, a mood chart, a moderated forum and a cockpit for Users and therapists. Free Products currently include a subject-specific newsletter, certain course modules from the learning platform, supporting material for the learning platform and a simplified version of the mood chart. More detailed information is available on the Website. Products ordered by the customer in the booking process are each an integral part of the contract. The provision of Free Products can be suspended, limited or changed at any time by SOFY without giving reasons.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Formation of contract</h4>
        <p>
            4.1 A contract is made between SOFY and the User when the User books one or more Products or Free Products. <br>
            4.2 Before a contract is made, the User must sign up on the Website or the mobile application of SOFY in the course of making their order (booking). The User must enter his or her email address and select a password. It is the duty of the User to keep their password secret and to secure it sufficiently against unauthorized access by third parties. In the event of ordering (paid) Products, the User must enter certain additional data (as shown on the Website), in particular, their address and the data required for payment processing. The information given must be truthful. SOFY has the right to decline the registration of Users without giving reasons. After registration, the User will receive confirmation of the receipt of registration
        </p>
        <h4>5. Prices and Payment Terms</h4>
        <p>
            5.1 The prices for the provision of Products are available on the Website. The prices and conditions published on the Website at the time the contract is made apply. The price quoted includes the statutory value added tax and other price components and is immediately due for payment when the contract is made. If a subscription is made, payment is made monthly in advance. <br>
            5.2 The payment options mentioned on the Website are available to the User. <br>
            5.3 In the event that SOFY has entered into a contractual agreement – with respect to the provision of Products – with a company, health insurer, other legal entity or doctors or therapists (hereafter „third-party buyer“), and a User is an employee or beneficiary of the third-party buyer, the User in question can use the Products for free. In this case, the terms of use for the Products will be agreed between the User and the third-party buyer and in the contract between SOFY and the third-party buyer. Apart from the regulations in point 4. below, in this case, the T&Cs also apply, unchanged, to the relationship between SOFY and the User.
            5.4 In the event of late payment, the User is liable for the payment of statutory default interest on the total amount owed. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by the law, the User owes the reimbursement of the reasonable and necessary judicial and extrajudicial collection measures.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Right of withdrawal</h3>
        <p>
            6.1 The User has the right to withdraw from the contract without giving any reasons within 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. For the purpose of exercising the right of withdrawal, the User must provide SOFY with a corresponding unequivocal declaration of the decision to withdraw from this contract (for example, by post, fax or email). To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient that the User sends the declaration exercising the right to withdraw before the withdrawal period has expired. Users can use the model withdrawal form available on the Website. <br>
            form available on the Website. <br>
            <a href="#">Example of an withdrawal form as PDF</a>  <br>
            <a href="#">Example of an withdrawal form as text-document</a>  <br>
            6.2 The withdrawal notice must be sent to SOFY using the following contact details: <br>
            SOFY GmbH, <br>
            Büropark Donau, Inkustraße 1-7 <br>
            3400 Klosterneuburg <br>
            Telefon: +43 (0)2243 24856 <br>
            E-Mail: <a href="#">info@sofy.group</a> <br>

            6.3 If a User withdraws this contract, SOFY will refund all payments already received from this User without undue delay, and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which SOFY is informed about the User´s decision to withdraw from this contract. Except in the case of a specific alternative agreement, SOFY will use the same method of payment used by the User to make the repayment. SOFY will not charge any fees for repayment. <br>
            6.4 However, the right to withdraw expires early on the purchase of Products if SOFY – with the User´s prior express consent and his acknowledgment that he loses his right of withdrawal if the performance of the Products by SOFY has begun early and after provision of a copy or confirmation of the contract concluded on a durable medium (e-mail) together with the mentioned confirmation of the User´s prior express consent and the User´s acknowledgement of the loss of the right of withdrawal - has begun with the performance of the Products before the withdrawal period has expired.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the order process the User confirms the following passage: “I expressly agree, that you begin with the performance of the Products before the expiry of the withdrawal period. I acknowledge that I lose my right of withdrawal with giving this consent and the beginning of the performance of the Products by SOFY before the expiry of the withdrawal period and after provision of a copy or confirmation of the contract concluded on a durable medium (e-mail) together with the mentioned confirmation of my prior express consent and the acknowledgement of the loss of the right of withdrawal.”
        </p>
        <h3>7. User responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
            7.1 Users must provide the necessary hardware and software for the use of the Website and Products along with the necessary internet access and telephone connection. <br>
            7.2 Users must comply with all applicable statutory or other legal regulations and all obligations under these T&Cs when using the Products. In particular, Users must refrain from the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            The storage, publication and transmission of illegal content or content that violates the rights of third parties, in particular copyright or ancillary copyright, other property rights or personal rights; <br>
            The unlawful intimidation, abuse, discrimination or harassment of others on the basis of gender, race, religion or beliefs; <br>
            The storage or transmission of the personal data of other Users insofar as the persons concerned do not agree with it or no legal authorization exists; <br>
            The use of Products or Free Products for committing criminal or unlawful acts (e.g. spamming, hacking etc.); <br>
            The misuse of Products or Free Products with fraudulent intentions or acquiescence to misuse by third parties; <br>
            Giving permission to third parties to repeatedly use Products or Free Products without the prior consent of SOFY.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Changes to customer data, receipt of declarations</h3>
        <p>
            8.1 The User is obliged to inform SOFY immediately of changes to their name, address, e-mail address, bank details or the loss of their contractual capability.8.2 Should the User not receive declarations because they did not inform SOFY of changes to the electronic or postal addresses mentioned in Clause 8.1, and SOFY has sent declarations to one of these addresses, these declarations will still be deemed to have been received by the User. This term does not apply to Consumers. 8.3 Legally significant declarations from SOFY may also be communicated to the User via text message or to an e-mail address provided by the Customer for this purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Liability</h3>
        <p>
            9.1 SOFY always endeavours to ensure that Products are available without disruption and that transmissions are error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed. The User’s access to the Website or user account may also occasionally be disrupted or restricted to allow for repair, maintenance or the installation of news facilities and Products. <br>
            9.2 Provided that nothing else is subsequently regulated, SOFY is only liable for damages caused by its executive organs or vicarious agents – insofar as these do not concern damage to the person – in the case of intent or gross negligence. <br>
            9.3 In cases of slight negligence, liability shall be limited to foreseeable damage typical of the contract, according to reason and amount.
            <br>
            9.4 Liability is completely excluded in the case of the provision of Free Products.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Copyright and industrial property rights</h3>
        <p>
            10.1 The Products, Free Products, Website, underlying software and database and other content provided by SOFY are protected by copyright. The adaptation, reproduction, distribution and every kind of exploitation by the User requires the prior written consent of SOFY. Downloads and copies of the Website are only permitted for contractual use. Copying, sharing, sending or publishing information and data in any form is therefore prohibited, unless the Website explicitly offers such a function. <br>
            10.2 SOFY grants the User the non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Website and Products, as well as Free Products, subject to compliance with these T&Cs and all other applicable and any other contractual terms. The right of use of the program expires at the end of the contract period. The User is not authorized,
        </p>
        <p>
            to grant access to third parties, in particular to lease, lend, reproduce, resell or in any other way distribute and transfer; <br>
            to use the Products as well as Free Products for commercial or business activities, in particular for the provision of services for third parties in return for payment; <br>
            to activate and use functionalities of the Website or Products, as well as Free Products, for which he or she was granted no rights of use; <br>
            to modify, translate, duplicate, decompile or examine the features of the source code of the Website or Products and Free Products, except as permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h3>11. Confidentiality and data protection</h3>
        <p>
            11.1 The transmission and processing of User data takes place in compliance with the provisions of the applicable national data protection regulations and the GDPR and is explained in more detail in the data protection declaration under Data Protection. In the privacy statement, the data subject rights of the User are also implemented according to the relevant data protection regulations. <br>
            11.2 Consent to the privacy statement is made by a separate declaration in the course of registration. Separate consent is made by clicking the confirmation checkbox provided for this purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>12. Terms and Termination</h3>
        <p>
            12.1 The term of the contracts between SOFY and the User for (paid) Products is always regulated on the Website. Temporary Products end after the expiry of the respective term specified on the Website for the Product concerned (for example, after the duration of the learning modules). Permanent Products (for example, the provision of the mood chart) can be terminated without a specific form by both parties at any time, subject to a notice period of 2 weeks. <br>
            12.2 The right to early extraordinary termination by both parties for good cause remains unaffected. Good causes for an extraordinary termination by SOFY include, among others, breaches of duty of the User in accordance with Clause 7.
        </p>
        <h3>13. General Regulations</h3>
        <p>
            13.1 Should individual provisions of these T&Cs be or become ineffective or should a significant item not be regulated, the validity of the remaining terms remains unaffected. <br>
            13.2 These terms and conditions are subject to the application of Austrian law. The rules of international private law and the UN Sales Convention are not applicable, provided that there are no constraining conflict-of-law rules. <br>
            13.3 The place of jurisdiction for all claims arising from a contractual relationship with SOFY is, to the extent legally permissible, the competent court in Klosterneuburg, Austria. For claims concerning a contract between SOFY and a consumer within the meaning of the Austrian consumer protection law, the agreed place of jurisdiction shall be deemed to be that in which the consumer has their domicile, habitual residence or place of employment.
