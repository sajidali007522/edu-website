After registration, the User receives confirmation of the receipt of registration
        </p>
        <h4>5. Prices and Terms of Payment </h4>
        <p>
            The prices for the provision of the Products are indicated on the Website. The prices and conditions published on the Website at the time the contract is concluded apply. The price quoted includes the statutory value added tax and other price components and is payable immediately upon conclusion of the contract. Payments for subscription variants are payable monthly in advance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The payment options detailed on the Website are available to the User. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that SOFY has entered into a contractual agreement pertaining the provision of Products with a company, health insurer, other legal entity or medical doctors or therapists (hereinafter referred to as „third-party buyer“), and a User is an employee or beneficiary of the third-party buyer, the concerned User may use the Products free of charge. In this case, the terms of use for the Products are agreed between the User and the third-party buyer and in the contract between SOFY and the third-party buyer. Apart from the regulations in point 4., the T&Cs also apply unchanged, to the relationship between SOFY and the User. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event of a delay in payment, the User undertakes to pay the statutory default interest on the total amount owed. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, the User owes the reimbursement of the appropriate and necessary judicial and extrajudicial collection measures
        </p>
        <h3>6. Right of Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>
            The User is entitled to withdraw from the contract without stating any reasons within 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. For the purpose of exercising the right of withdrawal, the User must inform SOFY (for example, by post, fax or email) of the decision to withdraw from this contract by making a corresponding unequivocal declaration.

Except if expressly agreed otherwise, SOFY will refund the User through the same method of payment as applied by the User. SOFY will not charge any refund fees. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the right of withdrawal from the purchase of Products expires early if SOFY – with the User´s prior express consent and acknowledgment of the loss of the right of withdrawal when the Products are made available ahead of time by SOFY and after provision of a copy or confirmation of the contract concluded on a durable medium (e-mail) together with the aforementioned declaration of the User’s consent and the User´s acknowledgement of the loss of the right of withdrawal - commences the provision of the Products before the expiry of the otherwise existing withdrawal period.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the order process the User confirms the following passage: “I expressly agree to the provision of the Products before the expiry of the withdrawal period. I acknowledge that by consenting I revoke my right of withdrawal if SOFY commences the provision of the Products before the expiry of the otherwise applicable withdrawal period – after provision of a copy or confirmation of the contract concluded on a durable medium (email), along with the aforementioned declaration of my prior express consent and the acknowledgement of the loss of the right of withdrawal.

        <h3>7. Obligations of the User </h3>
        <p>
            Users must be responsible for providing the necessary hardware and software for the use of the Website and Products as well as the required internet access or telephone connection. 
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            The User undertakes to immediately notify SOFY of changes to their name, address, email address, bank details or of the loss of his legal capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the User does not receive notices and declarations due to a failure to inform SOFY of changes to the electronic or postal addresses mentioned in Clause 8.1, and SOFY has sent declarations to one of these addresses, these declarations are still deemed to have been received by the User. This provision does not apply to Consumers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Legally significant notices by SOFY may also be served to the User via text message or to an email address provided by the Customer for this purpose. 
        </p>
        <h3>9. Liability </h3>
        <p>
            SOFY always endeavors to ensure that the Products are available without disruption and that transmissions are error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed. The User’s access to the Website or User account may also occasionally be disrupted or restricted to enable repair, maintenance or the installation of news facilities or services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise agreed, SOFY shall only be liable for damages caused by its executive body or agents – insofar as these do not concern personal injury – in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In cases of slight negligence, liability shall be limited in cause and amount to typical, predictable damage from the infringement of the contractual obligations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Liability is completely excluded for the provision of Free Products. 
        </p>
        <h3>10. Copyright and Industrial Property Rights</h3>
        <p>
            The Products, Free Products, Website, underlying software and database and other content provided by SOFY are protected by copyright.  The adaptation, reproduction, distribution and every kind of exploitation by the User requires the prior written consent of SOFY.

It is therefore not permitted to copy, share, send or publish information and data in any form or medium, unless the Website explicitly offers such a function.
        </p>
        <p>
            SOFY grants the User the non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Website and Products, as well as Free Products, subject to compliance with these T&Cs and all other applicable and any other contractual terms. The right of use of the program expires at the end of the contract period. The User is not authorized;
        </p>
        <p>
            to make his account accessible to third parties, in particular to lease, lend, reproduce, resell or in any other way distribute and transfer;
        </p>
        <p>
            to use the Products or Free Products for commercial or business activities, in particular the provision of services to third parties for consideration;
        </p>
        <p>
            to activate and use functionalities of the Website or Products or Free Products he was not granted the right to use;
        </p>
        <p>
            to modify, translate, duplicate, decompile or examine the features of the source code of the Website or the Products or Free Products, unless permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h3>11. Confidentiality and Privacy Protection</h3>
        <p>

In the privacy statement, the rights of the concerned User are set out in accordance with the relevant data protection regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consent to the privacy statement is given by a separate declaration during registration. Separate consent is given by activating the provided field. 
        </p>
        <h3>12. Term and Termination</h3>
        <p>
            The term of the contracts between SOFY and the User for (paid) Products is regulated respectively on the Website. Fixed-term Products expire after the lapse of the respective term specified on the Website (for example, after the duration of the learning modules). Permanent Products (for example, the provision of the mood diagram) are informally terminable  by either party at any time, subject to a notice period of 2 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The right to early, extraordinary termination by either party for good cause shall remain unaffected. Good causes for an extraordinary termination by SOFY include, among others, infringement of the contractual obligations in accordance with Clause 7 by the User.
        </p>
        <h3>13. General Regulations </h3>
        <p>
            Should individually provisions of these T&Cs be or become legally ineffective or should an essential aspect not be regulated; the effectiveness of the remaining provisions remains unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
            These terms and conditions are subject to the application of Austrian law. The reference norms of international private law and the UN Sales Law are not applicable unless there are compelling conflicts of law. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The place of jurisdiction for all claims arising from a contractual relationship with SOFY is, to the extent legally permissible, the competent court in Klosterneuburg, Austria. For claims concerning a contract between SOFY and a consumer within the scope of the Austrian consumer protection law, the agreed place of jurisdiction shall be deemed to be that in which the consumer has their residence, habitual residence or place of employment.
