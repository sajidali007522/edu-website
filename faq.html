                        edupression.com® is a manufacturer and supplier of medical devices.

                        No, that is not the goal of edupression.com®. We want to be the platform for patients and depression specialists (doctors, psychologists, psychotherapists), on which both should find optimal conditions and products to combat depression. Exceptions to this can be the bridging of waiting times for a therapy place or - based on international guidelines (e.g. NICE guidelines) - the implementation of computer-assisted therapy for depression complaints with a PHQ9 value less than or equal to 9.

For those patients who have not yet worked with a depression specialist, we offer an overview with depression specialists - doctors, psychologists, therapists. Patients are welcome to contact them. This is an additional service from edupression.com®, which is currently under construction. We do not become contractual partners and do not receive any remuneration for this.

                    <p>
                        We also aim to bring more transparency to the treatment of depression. We offer patients various reports, which are summarized in a patient folder. This includes the mood chart report, the PHQ9 depression test and the 2-back test, to name a few. As a patient, you can share these reports with your depression specialist, with your family or friends and colleagues through various channels (mail, social media, ..). <br>
                        These reports and tests can also be an important basis for therapy decisions - please also discuss these reports with your depression specialist.

                    <p>
                        An upgrade from one package to another is currently not planned. Please use the offer of our free introductory package. This gives you the opportunity to get a good impression of the edupression.com® platform and our medical products. You essentially choose between the 6-month product with one-off payment or the annual subscription with monthly payment. Both products end automatically when they expire. We would recommend the subscription option because it gives you the opportunity to access content and products from edupression.com® for a longer period of time and thus support your optimal treatment success (including important maintenance therapy).
